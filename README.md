# Theoretical-Guarrantees---Recovery-of-Sparse-Graph-Signals
Code for the paper: "Theoretical Guarantees for Sparse Graph Signal Recovery". This codes studies the behavior of the graph Laplacian mutual coherence over the Erdős–Rényi graph as well as the sensor graphs. In addition, It examines the performance of the bounds suggested in the paper for the mutual coherence.
